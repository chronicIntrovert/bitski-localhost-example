# bitski-localhost-example

Below is an example of integrating the Bitski SDK for authentication using the provided callback.html at [https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js/tree/main/packages/browser/callback.html. ](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js/blob/main/packages/browser/callback.html)

This app uses svelte-kit, with the `callback.html` file provided under the `static` directory - this is the public directory for directly linking to static assets in svelte-kit. 

The entrypoint for the client code to log in via Bitski is under `src/routes/index.svelte`.
